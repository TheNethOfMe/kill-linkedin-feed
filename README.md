# LinkedIn Feed Killer
If you're like me, you hate LinkedIn. It's a gross website, and aren't we all using too many social media platforms to begin with? Unfortunatly, if you work in tech or certain other fields, you're pretty much forced to use it if you want a job. I wanted to do something to make LinkedIn an easier pill to swollow. The styles.css in this repo is a CSS file with a few lines of CSS you can use with the Stylus Chrome tool to get rid of the feed and other features on LinkedIn

## How to Use
You'll need to have the Stylus Chrome tool installed for this to work.

Navigate to the LinkedIn page and click on the Stylus icon in your Chrome toolbar. Where it says "Write Style For:" you should see the LinkedIn url underneith. Click on it and you'll get taken to another page where you can write your own CSS. Just copy and paste the code from the file in this repo into that text area and save. 

Tadah! No more LinkedIn feed! For good measure it also kills the ads and premium upsell links (on the home page, at least) as well as the "Today's News and Views" section (honesly, no one should have to look at that garbage) and the launchpad at the top that's always reminding you "how to get the most" out of LinkedIn. I find this helps me better use LinkedIn without getting frusterated with it. 

Of course, you can edit this file to suit your specific needs.

## Future plans
I may try making this into its own Chrome extention, but as it's only a few lines right now, this feels like overkill. But we'll see.
